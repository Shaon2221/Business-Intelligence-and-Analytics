# Business-Intelligence-and-Analytics
I have completed business intelligence and Analytics course from Macquarie University at coursera. There I learned some important fundamentals of statistics, as well as **implementation using Tableau**. Visualization, Data manipulation, time series analysis have done through exercise. So, I have decided to share those files with this community.
Thank You
